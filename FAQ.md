# Questions that people have asked

## What buttons do you use for `x`?
If it's not listed in the guide, then I don't. `Galaxy map`, `System map`, 
`Toggle Rotational Correction`, `Toggle Orbit Lines`, `Silent Running`, 
`Jettison All Cargo`, etc. are all handled via in game menus (`External Panel` 
for the maps, `Internal Panel` for the others). 

`Headlook` and related controls are not included since I fly exclusively in VR.

Feel free to change the mappings to suit your use.

## How do I change the mappings?
Go into the game menu, find the thing you want to map to a button, click the
mapping, press a button on the stick (with or without the `pinky` button pressed
depending on if you want it on the primary or alternative map).

## Got any tips when mapping buttons?
If you're going to move the 'major' functions (`Primary Fire`, `Secondary Fire`,
etc.) map both the un-shifted and shifted button presses to the action do you
don't suddenly lose the ability to do something important while doing something
unimportant.

## Can I get a copy of your joystick diagrams?
Maybe. For personal use you can just Photoshop the current ones. If you've got
and open source project that you want them for drop me a line and I can sort 
out the assets for you. If you want to use then commercially, or in a closed 
source application we'll need to talk.
